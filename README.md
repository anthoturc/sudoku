# Sudoku

This is a small side project I chose to do over the 12/2019 break. It is still in progress and I plan on adding more. I chose java because I have not used it in a while and because it has GUI libraries built in.

So far, the board will start out by solving the instance of the game and then respond to the moves that the user makes (shown in the image). This is pretty crude but I think I can expand on this quite a bit. I just needed the basic functionality of the board. The thing that took the longest was coming up with an algorithm that solved the board. My next step will be to change the way that the board responds to the input. Eventually I will add a timer so that the user can keep track of how long it takes to solve the board. I am looking forward to that.

I will add more about how to run the app and updates as I go.
