# Sudoku

This is a small side project I chose to do over the 12/2019 break. It is still in progress and I plan on adding more. I chose java because I have not used it in a while and because it has GUI libraries built in.

I could not decide on a way to give the user feedback about their choices. Still, this is a working game that will alert the user if they have successfully made the board. I plan on developing a web scraper to get the boards from a site and place them into the /boards directory.
